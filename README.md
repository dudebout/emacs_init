Emacs configuration:
====================

The configuration is split between:

+ `init.el`: code to install new packages at startup and calls to functions defined in ddb-conf.el
+ `ddb-conf.el`: actual configuration code organized by modes
+ `ddb-interactives.el`: interactive functions accumulated over the years
